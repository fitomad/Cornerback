## What is a Cornerback?

> A cornerback (CB) is a member of the defensive backfield or secondary in american football. Cornerbacks cover receivers most of the time, but also blitz and defend against such offensive running plays as sweeps and reverses. They create turnovers through hard tackles, interceptions, and deflecting forward passes.
